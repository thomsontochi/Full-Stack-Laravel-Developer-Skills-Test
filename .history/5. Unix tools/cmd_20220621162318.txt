In one Unix command, find all of the files in /tmp whose contents contain the word "foobar" (case-insensitive), 
and list them all in order from most-recently created to least-recently created.

solutio: we can search for all of the files in a specific dir with the following commad 

grep -r "foobar" /tmp

OR
grep -R "foobar" /tom/

Look for all files containing cacheRoot text on Linux:
grep -R cacheRoot /home/vivek/
