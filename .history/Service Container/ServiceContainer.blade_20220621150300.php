. Service Container
  Consider the following Laravel controller:

   class MyController extends Controller
   {
       private $provider;
       
       public function __construct(MyContentProvider $provider)
       {
           $this->provider = $provider;
       }
       
       public function getContent()
       {
          return view('index', [ 'content' => $this->provider->get() ]);
       }
   }
When this controller is instantiated, a fresh instance of MyContentProvider is passed to the controller without any other code changes.
 How does Laravel know how to construct the Controller? What if MyServiceProvider has dependencies on its own? Explain how this works.


// SOLUTION

            
 The function ___construct() is a core PHP function and not specific to Laravel alone.
In any PHP class if you define __construct() function it acts as the default constructor, that is, whenever a new object of the class is created, this function will be called.
and in this case a fresh instance of MyContentProvider , but Laravel service container is a powerful tool for managing class dependencies and performing dependency injection.
 Dependency injection is a fancy phrase that essentially means this: class dependencies are "injected" into the class via the constructor or, in some cases, "setter" methods.


 In this example, the MyContentProvider needs to retrieve users from a data source. So, we will inject a service that is able to retrieve users. In this context, our UserRepository most likely uses Eloquent to retrieve user information from the database. However, since the repository is injected, we are able to easily swap it out with another implementation. We are also able to easily "mock", or create a dummy implementation of the UserRepository when testing our application.
