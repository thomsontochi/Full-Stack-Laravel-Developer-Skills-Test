You've getting ready to submit a pull request to the coolapp repo. You branch contains two commits: M, followed by N. The lineage is this:

main:   X --> Y --> Z (HEAD commit is Z)
                     \
your-branch:          M --> N (HEAD commit is N)
You want to contribute the code back to the official coolapp repo, but you realize there is a really dumb typo in one of your source code comments (not commit messages) 
in commit M. You'd still like to submit the pull request as two commits M' and N', where M' is the fixed version of M, and N' is the same exact diff as N.
